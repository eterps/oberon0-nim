## Oberon-0 compiler in Nim

Partial implementation of an [Oberon-0](https://inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/CompilerConstruction/) compiler in Nim.
I implemented a fair amount of Oberon compiler fragments over time (mostly in Ruby), each time focusing on different aspects with respect to compiler construction.
In order to help others on this path I will start releasing more moving parts over time.
